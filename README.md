This is just a repositry of dumb projects, most of them are complete.
Feel free to use the code, although its most definately not optimized, I write spaghetti code for my own fun I promise its not just that I'm bad at programming.
If you have any surgestions for projects please let me know cuz I have very few left to do (they are all stored on other repos).

#Choice_DeParaliser
The Choise de-paraliser is a project to help me with time management, ironiclly it took 8 hours to deal with a logic error; so great life decicions I guess.

#GachaSys
This one is just my creating a dumb minigame to practice writing a reading data from files, and also creating something fun enough to kill time when I'm bored and have a computer around.

#Majic8Ball
This one is pretty self explanatory.
